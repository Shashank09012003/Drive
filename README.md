## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with these variables:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_api_key
```

4. Run the app:

```bash
node app.js
```

## 🧾 .gitignore Best Practices
